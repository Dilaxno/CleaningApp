"""QuickBooks integration - Accounting and invoicing"""

# Note: QuickBooks integration is kept in original files for now:
# - backend/app/routes/quickbooks.py - OAuth and API integration
#
# This will be refactored in a future phase due to:
# - Complex OAuth 2.0 flow
# - Token refresh management
# - QuickBooks API client integration
